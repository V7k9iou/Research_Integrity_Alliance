The Research Integrity Alliance conducts rigorous primary research to collect and analyse data on research malpractice in Canada. Our projects involve systematic investigations into various aspects of scientific integrity, including surveys of researchers, analyses of published literature, and examinations of institutional policies. By gathering first-hand data, we aim to provide an accurate picture of the state of research integrity in the country. These studies help identify trends, problem areas, and best practices, forming an empirical foundation for recommendations to improve the research ecosystem.
