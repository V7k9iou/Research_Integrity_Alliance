      ## We Stand for Truth in Science

      The Research Integrity Alliance is a non-profit organization dedicated to upholding the highest standards of scientific research. Our mission:

      - Identify and expose research malpractice
      - Promote ethical conduct in scientific studies
      - Safeguard the credibility of the scientific enterprise

      We focus on combating two major threats to scientific integrity:

      1. **Fraud**: Including data fabrication, falsification, and citation manipulation
      2. **Plagiarism**: In all its forms, from direct copying to idea theft

      Join us in our commitment to fostering a culture of honesty, transparency, and accountability in the scientific community.

      *Because integrity is the cornerstone of progress.*
