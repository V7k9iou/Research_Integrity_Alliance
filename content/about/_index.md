    title: Our Story
    text: |
      The Research Integrity Alliance emerged from a growing concern over declining trust in academic and governmental institutions. Our founders recognized the need to rebuild this trust by thoroughly investigating research practices. We believe that by understanding and improving the conditions for research integrity, we can cultivate an environment where Canadian research flourishes. Our goal is to nurture a robust and resilient research landscape, providing the public with confidence in the credibility and value of scientific endeavours across the country.

      ## What We Do
      
      The Research Integrity Alliance is dedicated to nurturing a robust and trustworthy research environment in Canada. We conduct comprehensive studies on research practices, focusing on identifying both challenges and exemplary conduct, while investigating instances of fraud and plagiarism to understand their root causes and impacts. Our work involves developing and promoting best practices that foster integrity in scientific studies, collaborating with institutions to implement supportive policies, and educating researchers and the public about the importance of research integrity. We also recognize and celebrate instances of exceptional research conduct.

    title: How We Do It
    text: |
      At the Research Integrity Alliance, our work is guided by four key principles that ensure the quality, reliability, and impact of our efforts:
      
      ## 1. Open Inquiry

      We approach every investigation and study with an open mind, free from preconceived notions or biases. Our research questions are designed to explore issues thoroughly, considering multiple perspectives and allowing the evidence to guide our conclusions. This principle ensures that our findings are objective and comprehensive.

      ## 2. Transparency

      We believe in full disclosure of our methods, data, and findings. All our research processes, from data collection to analysis, are documented and made available for scrutiny. This transparency not only builds trust in our work but also allows others to verify and build upon our research, fostering a culture of openness in the scientific community.

      ## 3. Building on Feedback

      We actively seek and incorporate feedback from diverse sources, including researchers, institutions, and the public. This iterative approach allows us to refine our methods, address potential blind spots, and ensure our work remains relevant and impactful. By embracing constructive criticism, we continuously improve the quality and relevance of our research and recommendations.

      ## 4. Understanding the World as It Is

      Our goal is to capture the reality of research practices, not an idealized version. We strive to present an accurate picture of the current state of research integrity, acknowledging both strengths and weaknesses in the system. This realistic approach enables us to identify practical, effective solutions to enhance research integrity in the real world.

      These principles work together to ensure that our research and white papers provide a solid foundation for improving research integrity across Canada and beyond.
